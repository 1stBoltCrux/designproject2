# User Interface Design Project 2

## Design Inspiration

* Shared Workspace - design inspired by early, hopeful Soviet propaganda
* Color scheme - Pastel reds, yellows and grey-blues
* Minimalist easy to follow design with blocky symbolic icons for navigation
* Most content will be constructed in sketch in order to fit along with creative DIY feel of the enterprise.

## Integrating the client's wishes

*  The design will be inspired by Soviet propaganda - - tough to be less corporate than that!
* The site will focus on the information the client wanted to specifically target like amenities, activities and space.
* Site design should appeal across the board and make people feel comfortable regardless of background - figurative art will be inclusive in nature.
