# User Interfact Design Project 2

## Design Inspiration

* Shared Workspace - design inspired by early, hopeful Soviet propaganda
* Color scheme - Pastel reds, yellows and grey-blues
* Minimalist easy to follow design with blocky symbolic icons for navigation
* Most content will be constructed in sketch in order to fit along with creative DIY feel of the enterprise.
