# User Interface Design Project 2 "Common Good"

### Author - Ted Leary

## Design Inspiration

* Shared Workspace - design inspired by early, hopeful Soviet propaganda
* Color scheme - Pastel reds, yellows and grey-blues
* Minimalist easy to follow design with blocky symbolic icons for navigation
* Most if not all art and icons will be constructed in sketch in order to fit along with creative DIY feel of the enterprise.

## Integrating the client's wishes

*  The design will be inspired by Soviet propaganda - as the client wanted to avoid "corporate" styling choices.
* The site will focus on the information the client wanted to specifically target like amenities, activities and space.
* Site design should appeal across the board and make people feel comfortable regardless of background - figurative art will be inclusive in nature.

## Notes

This site's first page is a clickable splash image that when clicked will show the main directory page.

The full mockup is now complate in css/sass - "amenities", "ourspace" and "activities" buttons now psuedo-link to their own respective mobile-level pages via JavaScript hide/show functions.

The mobile "common good" logo area now links back to the main page.
